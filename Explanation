***This is a simple project based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project will be a simple "To-Do List" application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them.

***Project Structure
index.html,
styles.css,
script.js.

****Explanation of html code--
*The head section includes metadata and the link to the CSS file.
The body contains the main elements of the to-do list:
An input field for entering tasks.
A button to add the entered task to the list.
An unordered list (ul) where tasks will be displayed.
The script.js file is included at the bottom to enable JavaScript functionality.


***Explanation of css code--
*Basic styling is applied to the body to center the content and give it a light background.
The .container class styles the main to-do list container with padding, border-radius, and a shadow.
The input and button elements are styled for better appearance and usability.
The ul and li elements are styled to look like cards with padding, background color, and rounded corners.
A class completed is defined to mark tasks as completed (strike-through effect).


***Explanation of javascript code--
*The script starts by selecting the relevant HTML elements (taskInput, addTaskButton, and taskList) using document.getElementById.
An event listener is added to the "Add Task" button that triggers when it's clicked
The input value is retrieved and trimmed of any extra spaces.
If the input is not empty, a new list item (li) is created and the task text is added as a text node.
A "Remove" button is also created and appended to the list item, with an event listener to remove the task when clicked.
The list item itself has an event listener to toggle the completed class when clicked, marking the task as done.
The list item is appended to the task list (ul), and the input field is cleared.


***This project is a simple demonstration of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a functional web application. You can extend it further by adding features like task editing, persistence (e.g., saving tasks in localStorage), and better error handling.
